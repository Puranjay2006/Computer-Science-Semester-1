# Memory in Computers: RAM and ROM

- #### RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory) are two essential components of computer hardware that store data.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

### _What is it?_
- #### RAM is a type of volatile memory that stores data temporarily while a computer is in use. This means that the data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.

### _Why it was made?_
- #### RAM was created to provide computers with a fast and flexible way to store data that can be accessed and modified quickly.
  
### _Its use:_ 
- #### RAM is used to store programs, data, and operating system files that are currently in use. It is essential for the computer's performance, as the CPU needs to access data stored in RAM to execute instructions.
  
### _Its importance:_
- #### RAM is crucial for a computer's performance. A computer with insufficient RAM may experience slowdowns or crashes.

## ROM (Read-Only Memory)

### _What is it?_
- #### ROM is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data permanently. The data stored in ROM cannot be modified by the user.
  
### _Why it was made?_
- #### ROM is used to store essential system software, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and firmware. This ensures that the computer can boot up and function properly even when there is no power.
  
### _Its use:_

# Computer Network

## Basic Network Concepts:

- #### Local Area Network (LAN): A network that connects devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or school.
- #### Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that connects computers over a large geographic area, such as a city, state, or country.
- #### Internet: A global network of interconnected computers and networks.
- #### Intranet: A private network within an organization that uses Internet technologies.
- #### Extranet: A private network that allows authorized external users to access an organization's resources.

## Network Components:

Network components are essential for connecting computers to each other and to the internet. They enable communication and data sharing between devices. 
Here are some of the key network components:

### Hardware Components:

- #### Network Interface Card (NIC): A physical component that connects a computer to a network. It can be built into the motherboard or added as a separate card.
- #### Router: A device that connects multiple networks together. It directs data packets to their correct destinations.
- #### Switch: A device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It forwards data packets based on their destination addresses.
- #### Modem: A device that connects a computer to the internet through a telephone line or cable connection.
- #### Hub: A simple device that broadcasts data packets to all connected devices.

### Software Components:

- #### Network Operating System (NOS): Software that manages network resources and communication.
- #### Network Protocols: Rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over a network. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.
- #### Network Drivers: Software that enables communication between the operating system and network hardware.

_These components work together to create a network infrastructure that allows computers to communicate and share data. The specific components used will depend on the size and complexity of the network._

## Network Protocols:

- #### TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The foundation of the internet. It defines how data is transmitted and received.
- #### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring web pages and other data on the internet.
- #### FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between computers.
- #### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending and receiving email.
- #### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

## Network Security:

- #### Firewall: A security system that controls network traffic.
- #### VPN (Virtual Private Network): A secure tunnel that allows users to access a network remotely.
- #### Encryption: The process of encoding data to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.

## Fundamental Concepts:

- #### IP Address (Internet Protocol Address): A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other.   
- #### DNS (Domain Name System): Translates human-readable domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) into numerical IP addresses.
- #### ISP (Internet Service Provider): A company that provides internet access to individuals and organizations.

## IP Versions:

- #### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): The older version of IP, using 32-bit addresses.
- #### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): The newer version of IP, using 128-bit addresses. It was introduced to address the depletion of IPv4 addresses.

## Other Network Terms:

- #### NAT (Network Address Translation): Allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
- #### MAC Address (Media Access Control Address): A unique identifier assigned to a network interface card.

# Network Adresses:

A network address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other by providing a specific location or address within the network.

There are three main types of network addresses:

- #### 1. Transport Layer - Port Address:

  - #### Purpose: Identifies specific applications or processes running on a device.
  - #### Format: A 16-bit number (0 to 65535).
  - #### Example: A web server might use port 80, while an email server might use port 25.

- #### 2. Network Layer - IP Address:

  - #### Purpose: Uniquely identifies a device on a network.
  - #### Format: IPv4 (32-bit) or IPv6 (128-bit).
  - #### Example: IPv4: 192.168.1.100, IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

- #### 3. Data Link Layer - MAC Address:

  - #### Purpose: A unique physical address burned into a network interface card (NIC).
  - #### Format: 48-bit hexadecimal number (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55).
  - #### Example: Used for communication within a local area network (LAN).

## _How it works?_

When a device wants to communicate with another device on a different network, it uses the IP address of the destination device. The IP address is then used to find the MAC address of the destination device, which is used to physically transmit the data. The port address is used to specify the specific application or process that the data is intended for.

### _Fun Fact_

- #### If you type the following link with ':80' already added to it, it will still open Google.com.
  _http://google.com:80_
  
  _(Click on the link to try it!)_

### _Why does this happen?_

Here's why:

- #### Default Port for HTTP: By default, web browsers use port 80 for communication with websites that use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- #### Implicit vs. Explicit Port: When you enter a website address (URL) like "[invalid URL removed]", the port number 80 is assumed by the browser. It's like a shorthand.
- #### Explicit Port: If you explicitly specify the port number, like "http://google.com:80", the browser still understands and uses port 80 to connect to the website.

So, both ways (with or without the port number) will successfully open Google.com in your web browser.
# OSI Model: A Framework for Networking

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a reference model that defines how different layers of a network interact with each other. It provides a conceptual framework for understanding the various components and protocols involved in network communication.

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

- #### 1. Physical Layer: Deals with the physical transmission of data, including hardware components like cables and network interfaces.
- #### 2. Data Link Layer: Handles error detection and correction, as well as framing data into packets.
- #### 3. Network Layer: Responsible for routing data packets between networks.
- #### 4. Transport Layer: Ensures reliable delivery of data, including flow control and error recovery.
- #### 5. Session Layer: Manages sessions between communicating devices.
- #### 6. Presentation Layer: Handles data formatting and encryption.
- #### 7. Application Layer: The top layer that interacts directly with user applications, such as web browsers and email clients.

_Each layer builds upon the services provided by the layer below it. For example, the Application Layer relies on the services of the Presentation Layer, which in turn relies on the Session Layer, and so on._

_While the OSI model is a theoretical framework, it provides a valuable tool for understanding network concepts and troubleshooting network issues._
